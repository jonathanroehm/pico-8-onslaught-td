The evil wizard, "The Corruptor", has attacked the city Rahgmar.

You, player, are a new general - and you're in charge of saving the entire city. This is your first job, and it was handed to you because all everyone else is off fighting The Corruptor at his base.

Rahgmar is valuable because of its natural gold deposits. The Corruptor also hates the King and Queen for their relentless destruction of his corrupted domain.

In retribution, The Corruptor wants the magic crystal found at the heart of the castle (and all the gold)... making The Corruptor super rich and super powerful.

The magic crystal allows one to see the future... however, anbyone who has attempted to use the magic crystal has gone insane shortly after using it.
